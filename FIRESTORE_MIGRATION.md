# Firestore Migration Summary

## What's Changed

Your BillFusion application has been successfully migrated from in-memory storage to Google Firestore for persistent data storage.

### Files Modified/Created:

1. **`server/firestore.ts`** - Firebase Admin SDK initialization
2. **`server/firestoreStorage.ts`** - Firestore implementation of storage interface
3. **`shared/schema.ts`** - Updated to use Zod schemas instead of Drizzle ORM
4. **`server/storage.ts`** - Updated to use FirestoreStorage by default
5. **`server/.env`** - Added Firebase configuration placeholders
6. **`server/.env.example`** - Environment variables template
7. **`FIRESTORE_SETUP.md`** - Detailed setup instructions

### Key Changes:

#### Schema Changes
- **Removed**: Drizzle ORM PostgreSQL schemas
- **Added**: Zod-based schemas for Firestore compatibility
- **Changed**: Decimal fields (subtotal, total, amount) now stored as strings to avoid precision issues

#### Storage Layer
- **Replaced**: MemStorage with FirestoreStorage for production use
- **Maintained**: Same interface, so no changes needed in route handlers
- **Added**: Automatic timestamp handling with Firestore server timestamps
- **Added**: Better error handling and logging

#### Data Structure
Collections in Firestore:
- `users` - User profiles and business information
- `clients` - Client contact information
- `invoices` - Invoice data with embedded items array
- `payments` - Payment transaction records

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Firebase Project** (see `FIRESTORE_SETUP.md`)
2. **Configure environment variables** in `server/.env`
3. **Test the implementation**
4. **Deploy with proper security rules**

## Benefits

✅ **Persistent Data**: No more data loss on server restart
✅ **Scalable**: Firestore scales automatically
✅ **Real-time**: Can add real-time features later
✅ **Offline**: Supports offline functionality
✅ **Secure**: Built-in authentication and security rules
✅ **Reliable**: Google's infrastructure with 99.95% uptime SLA

## Testing

After setting up Firebase credentials, test the following:
- User registration/login
- Creating clients
- Creating and updating invoices
- Payment processing
- Dashboard analytics

## Migration Notes

- **No data migration needed** since you were using in-memory storage
- **API endpoints remain the same** - no frontend changes required
- **Session handling unchanged** - still using express-session
- **Razorpay integration unchanged** - still fully functional

## Rollback Plan

If you need to temporarily rollback to in-memory storage:
```bash
# In server/.env
NODE_ENV=test
```

This will use the MemStorage implementation as a fallback.
